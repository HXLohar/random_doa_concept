I have zero idea what should a proper readme file look like, and this is my first time doing those.
So I'm just writing random things here.
I randomly came up with this idea after playing some DOA2 (Dead or Alive 2). Fantastic bonus buy experience, €9/buy, and can win upto €10,000.

This project is intended for fun purpose only.
Concept by me.

Some of the code is wrote by ChatGPT, because in terms of algorithm it should be better than me, and I'm mainly just a guy that only good at popping up a bunch of weird concept and ideas.

Main Game
5 Reels, 4 Rows.
14 Winning lines.
2S: Feature!
Scatters become wilds with multiplier.

For the Main game, there are 4 modes to choose from.
Basic Mode (1x/spin): basic mode description here.
Premium Mode (1.8x/spin): Guaranteed Scatter on reel 2. Greatly increase the chance of triggering the 2S Feature and Bonus rounds.
Cart Mode (10x/spin): Kind of like Money Cart, only 2 possible things can land: Scatter, and...blank symbol, which does nothing! 2S Feature is also disabled.
Premium Cart Mode (14x/spin): Cart Mode that also guarantees a Scatter on reel 2.

BONUS
3S: Bonus!
8 spins with Sticky Wilds!
2/3/4 Wilds on the same reel: Each of them get a x2/3/4 multiplier.
Landing additional Scatters will upgrade the bonus. +2 Spins, plus trigger the Wild Strike.

4S: Premium Bonus!
Now it's 10 spins!
Wild Strike at the beginning: 1-3 random blocks are replaced with Wild!
Landing additional Scatters will upgrade the bonus. +2 Spins, plus trigger the Wild Strike. Also "Both Ways" for the rest of the bonus.

5S: SUPER Bonus!
Now it's 12 spins!
Wild Strike at the beginning: 2-7 random blocks are replaced with Wild!
And...BOTH WAYS! This means:
A single payline can pay twice: Such as [H1][W][W][H3][H3] counts as H1, 3 OAKs + H3, 4 Oaks
This also doubles the payout for 5 OAKs wins.

Extra Spins!
Get up to +6 more spins!

+3 Spins, if there's at least 1 Wild on each reel.
+2 Spins, if there's at least 2 Wilds on each reel.
+1 Spin, if there's at least 3 Wilds on each reel.
INSTANT MAX WIN, if there's at least 4 Wilds on each reel. (Full Screen Wild)*
*Happens 1 in (big number here) every 5S SUPER Bonus.

Lucky Draw 
(I think that's more than enough variants)
Regular Draw
60/30/10% Chance of getting 3/4/5 S Bonus

Upside Down Draw
10/30/60% Chance of getting 3/4/5 S Bonus
We just flipped the pyramid upside down!
So that's a 60% chance of getting 5S at a super discounted price.
But hitting the unlucky 40%? Yo, get screwed!

Discount 5S Draw
85%: 5S Bonus
15%: NOTHING
Try to buy a 5S Bonus at a discount, and willing to take some risks? Take this!
Even if you hit the 5S Bonus, there's no guarantee you'll end up with a profit.
But if you missed, well, you get a guaranteed 0, oh, totally dead.

Risky 50/50 Draw
50%: NOTHING
30/10/10%: 3/4/5 S Bonus.

Double or Nothing Draw (Might get cancelled)
70%: 2S Feature
24%: 3S Bonus
5%: 4S Premium Bonus
1%: 5S SUPER Bonus
If the total result is below 2x the cost of buying this lucky draw, you get Nothing. Yeah, xRip for the entire lucky draw!

Printer Mode!
It literally just print the result of each rounds, and save everything in a json file. Want to do a run of 10K spins and record some result? There you go! Details for bonus rounds are also included.
If you only want to know the result, and you don't care about any details, then there's also SUPER Printer Mode available. For every round, including bonus rounds, you only get one single line of result, which tells you how much you won. Nothing more than that.
Want to quickly go through a lot of bonus rounds, without buying it directly? Try Premium Cart Mode + Printer Mode!

MAX WIN
160,000 times your base bet!

Any amount would be greatly appreciated, doing $0.2 spins isn't a cheap hobby and I'm unable win enough to sustain this. I mean, when it comes to $600-$1000 per month it's not a small number.

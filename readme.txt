I have zero idea what should a proper readme file look like, and this is my first time doing those.
So I'm just writing random things here.
I randomly came up with this idea after playing some DOA2 (Dead or Alive 2). Fantastic bonus buy experience, €9/buy, and can win upto €10,000. 

This project is only intended for fun purpose only.
Concept by me.
Some of the code is wrote by ChatGPT, because in terms of algorithm it should be better than me, and I'm mainly just a guy that only good at popping up a bunch of weird concept and ideas.

Paytable: 1x = 1
W: 5/10/25
H1: 2/4/10
H2: 1.6/3.2/8
H3: 1.4/3/7
H4: 1.2/2.6/6
H5: 1/2.2/5
A:  0.6/1.4/3.5
K:  0.5/1.0/2.5
Q:  0.4/0.8/1.5
J:  0.3/0.6/1.2
10: 0.2/0.5/1.0

Main Game
5 Reels, 4 Rows.
[NUMBNER] Winning lines.
2S: Feature!
Scatter become wilds. Depending on their height? It might have a multiplier of up to 4x (when on the 1st row). It's also possible to trigger a Wild Strike, which place up to 2 wilds with a multiplier that follow the rules mentioned above. This have no impact on native wilds.

For the Main game, there are 4 modes to choose from.
Basic Mode (1x/spin): basic mode description here.
Premium Mode (1.8x/spin): Guaranteed Scatter on reel 2. Greatly increase the chance of triggering the 2S Feature and Bonus rounds.
Cart Mode (10x/spin): Kind of like Money Cart, only 2 possible things can land: Scatter, and...blank symbol, which does nothing! 2S Feature is also disabled.
Premium Cart Mode (14x/spin): Cart Mode that also guarantees a Scatter on reel 2.

Printer Mode!
It literally just print the result of each rounds, and save everything in a json file. Want to do a run of 10K spins and record some result? There you go! Details for bonus rounds are also included.
If you only want to know the result, and you don't care about any details, then there's also SUPER Printer Mode available. For every round, including bonus rounds, you only get one single line of result, which tells you how much you won. Nothing more than that.
Want to quickly go through a lot of bonus rounds, without buying it directly? Try Premium Cart Mode + Printer Mode! 

3S: Bonus!
12 spins with Sticky Wilds!
2/3/4 Wilds on the same reel: Each of them get a x2/3/4 multiplier.
Landing additional Scatters will upgrade the bonus. +2 Spins, plus trigger the Wild Strike.

4S: Premium Bonus!
Now it's 14 spins!
Wild Strike at the beginning: 1-3 random blocks are replaced with Wild!
Landing additional Scatters will upgrade the bonus. +2 Spins, plus trigger the Wild Strike. Also "Both Ways" for the rest of the bonus.

5S: SUPER Bonus!
Now it's 16 spins!
Wild Strike at the beginning: 2-7 random blocks are replaced with Wild!
And...BOTH WAYS! This means:
A single payline can pay twice: Such as [H1][W][W][H3][H3] counts as H1, 3 OAKs + H3, 4 Oaks
This also doubles the payout for 5 OAKs wins.

Extra Spins!
Get up to +6 more spins!

+3 Spins, if there's at least 1 Wild on each reel.
+2 Spins, if there's at least 2 Wilds on each reel.
+1 Spin, if there's at least 3 Wilds on each reel.
INSTANT MAX WIN, if there's at least 4 Wilds on each reel. (Full Screen Wild)

MAX WIN
160,000 times your base bet! That's pretty high, huh?

Bonus Buy
3S Bonus: The price is 75x.

5S SUPER Bonus: The price is 1900x.

Any amount would be greatly appreciated, since currently losing 5000x+ ($1000+) on slots per month is not very affordable for me.
Don't ask me why I lose that much without hitting a single 2000x, I've lost the ability to hit an average amount of bonus and changing casino/provider won't work, 1/200 bonus freq can easily become 3-5 bonus in 1500 spins.
